title: TUI
description: Using the OpenCode terminal user interface.
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

OpenCode provides an interactive terminal interface or TUI for working on your projects with an LLM.

Running OpenCode starts the TUI for the current directory.

```bash
opencode
```

Or you can start it for a specific working directory.

```bash
opencode /path/to/project
```

Once you're in the TUI, you can prompt it with a message.

```text
Give me a quick summary of the codebase.
```

---

## File references

You can reference files in your messages using `@`. This does a fuzzy file search in the current working directory.

:::tip
You can also use `@` to reference files in your messages.
:::

```text "@packages/functions/src/api/index.ts"
How is auth handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts?
```

The content of the file is added to the conversation automatically.

---

## Bash commands

Start a message with `!` to run a shell command.

```bash frame="none"
!ls -la
```

The output of the command is added to the conversation as a tool result.

---

## Commands

When using the OpenCode TUI, you can type `/` followed by a command name to quickly execute actions. For example:

```bash frame="none"
/help
```

Most commands also have keybind using `ctrl+x` as the leader key, where `ctrl+x` is the default leader key. [Learn more](/docs/keybinds).

Here are all available slash commands:

---

### compact

Compact the current session. _Alias_: `/summarize`

```bash frame="none"
/compact
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x c`

---

### details

Toggle tool execution details.

```bash frame="none"
/details
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x d`

---

### editor

Open external editor for composing messages. Uses the editor set in your `EDITOR` environment variable. [Learn more](#editor-setup).

```bash frame="none"
/editor
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x e`

---

### exit

Exit OpenCode. _Aliases_: `/quit`, `/q`

```bash frame="none"
/exit
```

**Keybind:** `ctrl+x q`

---

### export

## Editor setup

Both the `/editor` and `/export` commands use the editor specified in your `EDITOR` environment variable.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
    ```bash
    # Example for nano or vim
    export EDITOR=nano
    export EDITOR=vim

    # For GUI editors, VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, etc.
    # include --wait
    export EDITOR="code --wait"
    ```

    To make it permanent, add this to your shell profile;
    `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows (CMD)">
    ```bash
    set EDITOR=notepad

    # For GUI editors, VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, etc.
    # include --wait
    set EDITOR=code --wait
    ```

    To make it permanent, use **System Properties** > **Environment
    Variables**.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Windows (PowerShell)">
    ```powershell
    $env:EDITOR = "notepad"

    # For GUI editors, VS Code, Cursor, VSCodium, Windsurf, Zed, etc.
    # include --wait
    $env:EDITOR = "code --wait"
    ```

    To make it permanent, add this to your PowerShell profile.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Popular editor options include:

- `code` - Visual Studio Code
- `cursor` - Cursor
- `windsurf` - Windsurf
- `vim` - Vim editor
- `nano` - Nano editor
- `notepad` - Windows Notepad
- `subl` - Sublime Text

:::note
Some editors like VS Code need to be started with the `--wait` flag.
:::

Some editors need command-line arguments to run in blocking mode. The `--wait` flag makes the editor process block until closed.

## Configure

You can customize TUI behavior through your OpenCode config file.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tui": {
    "scroll_speed": 3
  }
}
```

### Options

- `scroll_speed` - Controls how fast the TUI scrolls when using scroll commands (default: `2`, minimum: `1`)
