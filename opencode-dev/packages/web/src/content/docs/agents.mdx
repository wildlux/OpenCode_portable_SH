title: Agents
description: Configure and use specialized agents.
---

Agents are specialized AI assistants that can be configured for specific tasks and workflows. They allow you to create focused tools with custom prompts, models, and tool access.

:::tip
Use the plan agent to analyze code and review suggestions without making any code changes.
:::

You can switch between agents during a session or invoke them with the `@` mention.

---

## Types

There are two types of agents in OpenCode; primary agents and subagents.

---

### Primary agents

Primary agents are the main assistants you interact with directly. You can cycle through them using the **Tab** key, or your configured `switch_agent` keybind. These agents handle your main conversation and can access all configured tools.

OpenCode comes with two built-in primary agents, **Build** and **Plan**. We'll
look at these below.

---

### Subagents

Subagents are specialized assistants that primary agents can invoke for specific tasks. You can also manually invoke them by **@ mentioning** them in your messages.

OpenCode comes with one built-in subagent, **General**. We'll look at this below.

---

## Built-in

OpenCode comes with two built-in primary agents and one built-in subagent.

---

### Build

_Mode_: `primary`

Build is the **default** primary agent with all tools enabled. This is the standard agent for development work where you need full access to file operations and system commands.

---

### Plan

_Mode_: `primary`

A restricted agent designed for planning and analysis. We use a permission system to give you more control and prevent unintended changes.
By default, all of the following are set to `ask`:

- `file edits`: All writes, patches, and edits
- `bash`: All bash commands

This agent is useful when you want the LLM to analyze code, suggest changes, or create plans without making any actual modifications to your codebase.

---

### General

_Mode_: `subagent`

A general-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use when searching for keywords or files and you're not confident you'll find the right match in the first few tries.

---

## Usage

1. For primary agents, use the **Tab** key to cycle through them during a session. You can also use your configured `switch_agent` keybind.

2. Subagents can be invoked:
   - **Automatically** by primary agents for specialized tasks based on their descriptions.
   - Manually by **@ mentioning** a subagent in your message. For example.

     ```txt frame="none"
     @general help me search for this function
     ```

3. **Navigation between sessions**: When subagents create their own child sessions, you can navigate between the parent session and all child sessions using:
   - **Ctrl+Right** (or your configured `session_child_cycle` keybind) to cycle forward through parent → child1 → child2 → ... → parent
   - **Ctrl+Left** (or your configured `session_child_cycle_reverse` keybind) to cycle backward through parent ← child1 ← child2 ← ... ← parent

   This allows you to seamlessly switch between the main conversation and specialized subagent work.

---

## Configure

You can customize the built-in agents or create your own through configuration. Agents can be configured in two ways:

---

### JSON

Configure agents in your `opencode.json` config file:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "mode": "primary",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/build.txt}",
      "tools": {
        "write": true,
        "edit": true,
        "bash": true
      }
    },
    "plan": {
      "mode": "primary",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false,
        "bash": false
      }
    },
    "code-reviewer": {
      "description": "Reviews code for best practices and potential issues",
      "mode": "subagent",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
      "prompt": "You are a code reviewer. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability.",
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "edit": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Markdown

You can also define agents using markdown files. Place them in:

- Global: `~/.config/opencode/agent/`
- Per-project: `.opencode/agent/`

```markdown title="~/.config/opencode/agent/review.md"
---
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
mode: subagent
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
temperature: 0.1
tools:
  write: false
  edit: false
  bash: false
---

You are in code review mode. Focus on:

- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs and edge cases
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

Provide constructive feedback without making direct changes.
```

The markdown file name becomes the agent name. For example, `review.md` creates a `review` agent.

---

## Options

Let's look at these configuration options in detail.

---

### Description

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the agent does and when to use it.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "review": {
      "description": "Reviews code for best practices and potential issues"
    }
  }
}
```

This is a **required** config option.

---

### Temperature

Control the randomness and creativity of the LLM's responses with the `temperature` config.

Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic, while higher values increase creativity and variability.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "temperature": 0.1
    },
    "creative": {
      "temperature": 0.8
    }
  }
}
```

Temperature values typically range from 0.0 to 1.0:

- **0.0-0.2**: Very focused and deterministic responses, ideal for code analysis and planning
- **0.3-0.5**: Balanced responses with some creativity, good for general development tasks
- **0.6-1.0**: More creative and varied responses, useful for brainstorming and exploration

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "analyze": {
      "temperature": 0.1,
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/analysis.txt}"
    },
    "build": {
      "temperature": 0.3
    },
    "brainstorm": {
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/creative.txt}"
    }
  }
}
```

If no temperature is specified, OpenCode uses model-specific defaults; typically 0 for most models, 0.55 for Qwen models.

---

### Disable

Set to `true` to disable the agent.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "review": {
      "disable": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Prompt

Specify a custom system prompt file for this agent with the `prompt` config. The prompt file should contain instructions specific to the agent's purpose.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "review": {
      "prompt": "{file:./prompts/code-review.txt}"
    }
  }
}
```

This path is relative to where the config file is located. So this works for both the global OpenCode config and the project specific config.

---

### Model

Use the `model` config to override the default model for this agent. Useful for using different models optimized for different tasks. For example, a faster model for planning, a more capable model for implementation.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Tools

Control which tools are available in this agent with the `tools` config. You can enable or disable specific tools by setting them to `true` or `false`.

```json title="opencode.json" {3-6,9-12}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "tools": {
    "write": true,
    "bash": true
  },
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "tools": {
        "write": false,
        "bash": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
The agent-specific config overrides the global config.
:::

You can also use wildcards to control multiple tools at once. For example, to disable all tools from an MCP server:

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "readonly": {
      "tools": {
        "mymcp_*": false,
        "write": false,
        "edit": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Permissions

You can configure permissions to manage what actions an agent can take. Currently, the permissions for the `edit`, `bash`, and `webfetch` tools can be configured to:

- `"ask"` — Prompt for approval before running the tool
- `"allow"` — Allow all operations without approval
- `"deny"` — Disable the tool

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "edit": "deny"
  }
}
```

You can override these permissions per agent.

```json title="opencode.json" {3-5,8-10}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "edit": "deny"
  },
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": "ask"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also set permissions in Markdown agents.

```markdown title="~/.config/opencode/agent/review.md"
---
description: Code review without edits
mode: subagent
permission:
  edit: deny
  bash:
    "git diff": allow
    "git log*": allow
    "*": ask
  webfetch: deny
---

Only analyze code and suggest changes.
```

You can set permissions for specific bash commands.

```json title="opencode.json" {7}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "permission": {
        "bash": {
          "git push": "ask"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This can take a glob pattern.

```json title="opencode.json" {7}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "permission": {
        "bash": {
          "git *": "ask"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And you can also use the `*` wildcard to manage permissions for all commands.
Where the specific rule can override the `*` wildcard.

```json title="opencode.json" {8}
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "permission": {
        "bash": {
          "git status": "allow",
          "*": "ask"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mode

Control the agent's mode with the `mode` config. The `mode` option is used to determine how the agent can be used.

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "agent": {
    "review": {
      "mode": "subagent"
    }
  }
}
```

The `mode` option can be set to `primary`, `subagent`, or `all`. If no `mode` is specified, it defaults to `all`.

---

### Additional

Any other options you specify in your agent configuration will be **passed through directly** to the provider as model options. This allows you to use provider-specific features and parameters.

For example, with OpenAI's reasoning models, you can control the reasoning effort:

```json title="opencode.json" {6,7}
{
  "agent": {
    "deep-thinker": {
      "description": "Agent that uses high reasoning effort for complex problems",
      "model": "openai/gpt-5",
      "reasoningEffort": "high",
      "textVerbosity": "low"
    }
  }
}
```

These additional options are model and provider-specific. Check your provider's documentation for available parameters.

:::tip
Run `opencode models` to see a list of the available models.

---

## Create agents

You can create new agents using the following command:

```bash
opencode agent create
```

This interactive command will:

1. Ask where to save the agent; global or project-specific.
2. Description of what the agent should do.
3. Generate an appropriate system prompt and identifier.
4. Let you select which tools the agent can access.
5. Finally, create a markdown file with the agent configuration.

---

## Use cases

Here are some common use cases for different agents.

- **Build agent**: Full development work with all tools enabled
- **Plan agent**: Analysis and planning without making changes
- **Review agent**: Code review with read-only access plus documentation tools
- **Debug agent**: Focused on investigation with bash and read tools enabled
- **Docs agent**: Documentation writing with file operations but no system commands
