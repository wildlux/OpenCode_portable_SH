:::tip
Check out the [**GitLab docs**](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agent_assistant/) for up to date instructions.
:::

1.  Configure your GitLab environment
2.  Set up CI/CD
3.  Get an AI model provider API key
4.  Create a service account
5.  Configure CI/CD variables
6.  Create a flow config file, here's an example:

        <details>

    <summary>Flow configuration</summary>

    ```yaml
    image: node:22-slim
    commands:
      - echo "Installing opencode"
      - npm install --global opencode-ai
      - echo "Installing glab"
      - export GITLAB_TOKEN=$GITLAB_TOKEN_OPENCODE
      - apt-get update --quiet && apt-get install --yes curl wget gpg git && rm --recursive --force /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      - curl --silent --show-error --location "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upciti/wakemeops/main/assets/install_repository" | bash
      - apt-get install --yes glab
      - echo "Configuring glab"
      - echo $GITLAB_HOST
      - echo "Creating opencode auth configuration"
      - mkdir --parents ~/.local/share/opencode
      - |
        cat > ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json << EOF
        {
          "anthropic": {
            "type": "api",
            "key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
          }
        }
        EOF
      - echo "Configuring git"
      - git config --global user.email "opencode@gitlab.com"
      - git config --global user.name "Opencode"
      - echo "Testing glab"
      - glab issue list
      - echo "Running Opencode"

        Please execute the requested task using the available GitLab tools.
        Be thorough in your analysis and provide clear explanations.

        <important>
        Please use the glab CLI to access data from GitLab. The glab CLI has already been authenticated. You can run the corresponding commands.

        If you are asked to summarize an MR or issue or asked to provide more information then please post back a note to the MR/Issue so that the user can see it.
        You don't need to commit or push up changes, those will be done automatically based on the file changes you make.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use opencode in GitLab.

:::tip
You can configure to use a different trigger phrase than `@opencode`.
:::

- **Explain an issue**

  Add this comment in a GitLab issue.

  ```
  @opencode explain this issue
  ```

  opencode will read the issue and reply with a clear explanation.

- **Fix an issue**

  In a GitLab issue, say:

  ```
  @opencode fix this
  ```

  opencode will create a new branch, implement the changes, and open a merge request with the changes.

- **Review merge requests**

  Leave the following comment on a GitLab merge request.

  ```
  @opencode review this merge request
  ```

  opencode will review the merge request and provide feedback.
